# 🧠 Image Processing Project

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates basic image processing techniques using Python and OpenCV, including color adjustment, Gaussian blur, noise reduction, edge detection, and histogram-based feature extraction.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open the script in **Google Colab**.
2. Run all cells.
3. Upload an image when prompted (`.jpg`, `.png`, `.tif`).
4. Output files will be saved to `/output`.

## 🔧 Techniques Used
- **Brightness/Contrast Adjustment**: Enhance image visibility.
- **Gaussian Blur**: Reduce detail and smooth the image.
- **Non-local Means Denoising**: Remove noise while preserving edges.
- **Canny Edge Detection**: Detect edges and object boundaries.
- **Histogram Features**: Color distribution for feature extraction.

## 📂 Output Files
- Processed images (brightness, blur, denoise, edges).
- `.npy` file containing feature vector.

## ⚠️ Known Limitations
- Assumes colored (3-channel) input images.
- Histogram features are basic — not for advanced classification tasks.
